# Algorithms_SummerWork
This is my collection of work from Summer '21 working under Dinesh Mehta, where I developed coursework for the Algorithms class (CSCI 406) at Colorado School of Mines.

I was tasked with developing new project pormpts, handouts, inputs and outputs for 3 semester projects which are outlined below

Project 1: Give students a NP-Complete Problem along with greedy and exhaustive heuristics. Their goal is to implement the algorithms and time them to verify the time complexities.
       1) Vertex Cover
       2) Mininimum Maximum Hamming Distance

Project 2: (Algo Bowl) Students are given an NP hard optimization problem where they work in teams to develop and algorithm to approximate the solution. They then develop their own input and submit it. They test their algorithm against other student's inputs and return an output that is verified and they are then scored by some optimization metric innate to the problem. 
        1) 


Project 3: (Dynamic Programming) Students are provided with a recurrence relation and then develop a dynamic programming algorithm with a tracebakc step to solve the problem specified.
        1) Tesseract Stacking: This is a 4D itertion of the Box Stacking Problem which in itself is an iteration of longest increasing subsequence
        2) Plane or Train: 
        3) Best Metro Network: This is an abstraction of the Optimal Binary Search Tree problem.
